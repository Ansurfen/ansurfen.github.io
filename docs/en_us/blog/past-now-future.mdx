During university, I explored many technologies out of curiosity, though most were just surface-level attempts without concrete projects. 
Yet this learning process profoundly satisfied my technical curiosity.

Key Explorations:
- **OS Development** (2021.09-2022.01): Studied "30-Day OS Development" and OS principles, gaining deep understanding of C/Assembly interactions.
- **Desktop Apps** (2022.01-2022.02): Developed mini-games with EasyX/Qt frameworks, attempted Plants vs Zombies clone.
- **MC Modding** (2022.05): Created Minecraft mods using Fabric, fulfilling childhood dreams though with less excitement than expected.
- **Unreal Engine** (2022.05-2022.08): Learned Blueprint visual scripting and C++ SDK development.
- **Blockchain** (2022.06-2022.07): Implemented basic blockchain in Go and Solidity smart contracts.
- **Database Systems** (2022.09-2022.10): Researched B+ trees and storage engines, experimented with Redis-like features.
- **Quant Trading** (2023.02): Simulated trading strategies using Backtrader with procedural noise algorithms.
- **Deep Learning** (2023.01-2023.02): Learned PyTorch fundamentals and CNN architectures.

This timeline was reconstructed from my memory and some commit histories in my repositories, so there might be minor inaccuracies.

As I reflect on this journey, I'm filled with mixed emotions. I never realized how many different things I explored during college, though with some regret lingering. I sometimes wonder - if I had chosen one path and stuck to it persistently, would the outcome have been different? 

During my graduate school preparation, I often heard this saying: "Don't romanticize the road not taken." And it's true - perhaps without all these experiences, I wouldn't be who I am today.

If you ask me what I learned from these four years, it would be the lesson of "living in the present" that crystallized during my grad school prep. And the cost? Perhaps it's not having a single substantial project that I'm truly proud of. 

I spent most of that time in my own bubble, never truly stepping out. I was active in many online groups too, but gradually came to understand that people's ideas and perspectives differ - debating who's right or wrong is meaningless. There's no need to insist on absolute truths, especially when we're all adults. It's simply not worth wasting energy on keyboard battles with strangers online.

Now, from grad school preparation to my current internship, I've largely stopped participating in those online groups. Truthfully, I just don't have the time or energy anymore.

Thank you for taking the time to read my story. May we all navigate the vast ocean of technology and find our true course. ðŸš¢
